      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pierina-from-peru&#34;&gt;Pierina from Peru&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is Pierina, and I’m from Peru. I created this blog as a space to share a bit about myself, my journey, and the things I love most in life — nature, teaching, and connecting with others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-background&#34;&gt;My Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I worked in the fashion industry as a model. At first, I enjoyed it, but over time, I began to feel disconnected. It started to feel too superficial. I realized that I admire the natural beauty of a woman much more than the artificial standards often pushed by the media — all the makeup, surgeries, and pressure to look a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
